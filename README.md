# facial-emotional-detection
Facial emotion detection is a technology that identifies human emotions from facial expressions using image processing and machine learning

1. Project Objective
To develop a facial emotion recognition system that can automatically detect human emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprise, neutral, etc. from facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a web camera.

2. Tools & Libraries Used

3. Dataset Collection
The dataset used is FER2013 (Facial Expression Recognition 2013) available on Kaggle.
ðŸ“¦ Dataset Link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013

Steps:
1. Download the dataset ZIP file from Kaggle.
2. Extract it into your project folder, for example:
     D:\facial_recognization\dataset\
3. Inside it, you will have folders like:
train/
validation/
test/ 
Each folder contains images categorized by emotion (angry, happy, sad, etc.).

   Step-by-Step:
   1) Import Libraries
   2) Load and Preprocess Data
   3) Build CNN Model
   4) Compile Model
   5) Set Callbacks and Train
   6) Plot Accuracy & Loss
   7) Real-Time Detection (run_demo.py)
       Step-by-Step:
